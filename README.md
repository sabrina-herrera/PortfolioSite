## General Information
A few of my goals when making this site, was to demonstrate my ability to 
1. Build a website from a design reference [Check out FIGMA file here](https://www.figma.com/file/YJxU8dBzxuPC4wc3zr0siP/PORTFOLIO-WEBSITE?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev&t=0gCuuFtfzolonitu-1)
2. Incorporate responsive design for a smooth user-experience via all devices
3. Create some practical and visually appealing user interactions using JavaScript


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- FIGMA


## Features
- Project sections expand/collapse with scroll position
- Fun Fact button for a personal touch
- Responsive design


## Challenges and Future Additions
Challenges
- The project exapnd/collapse feature took some time to figure out how to implement alongside responsive design.  I was able to easily create the effect if I had the project section fill the page from left to right; however, I really wanted to keep the content a consistant width as you scrolled through.  What I ended up figuring out was to use a media query to have my script determine which formula to follow for resizing the project sections via scrolling.  

To do:
- Create a design for the site that is large screen size friendly.  With the current layout, when the site is full screen on my large second monitor, some of the sections were just too big that you cannot see it entirely.  Because of this, I had to sacrifice taking advantage of a larger screen size and have those sections smaller in order to have each section fully viewable.
- Rework the site so my personal projects can be other pages on my portfolio site instead of different sites with the Netlify hosting domain.
